# Sales Trend Analysis Using Spreadsheets

## üìä Overview 

This comprehensive analysis addresses a key stakeholder question: **What is the sales trend?**

Spreadsheets were utilised as the primary data analytical tool to provide data-driven insights and actionable recommendations.

## üéØ Research Questions

To provide a complete answer, the analysis was structured around six key questions:

1. **Monthly sales volume trend**
2. **Monthly sales trend by sales method**
3. **Monthly sales trend by countries**
4. **Main reason driving sales**
5. **Relationship between delivery time and sales volume**
6. **Best seller**

## üîç Key Findings

The analysis revealed the following insights about monthly sales trends:

### Sales Growth Pattern
- **Steady growth** 
- Orders are primarily made **online**, but **offline orders generate higher profits** in the second half of the year

### Geographic Distribution
- **United States** leads in order volume

### Customer Behaviour
- Primary purchase drivers: **price and promotions**

### Delivery Performance
- Consistent **7-day delivery** from order placement
- **5-day average** between shipping and delivery
- This performance has been maintained throughout the observed period

### Top Performers
- **Leading seller**: the seller with an ID-277 (US market)

## üí° Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analysis findings, we recommend:

### 1. Investigate Online vs. Offline Profit Disparity
**Issue**: Online sales generate less profit despite higher volume

**Potential causes**:
- Lower pricing strategy for online products
- Product type differences (large/expensive items sold offline vs. small/cheaper items online)

**Action**: Analyse product categories by sales channel to identify pricing optimisation opportunities

### 2. Explore European Market Potential
**Issue**: Lower sales volume in Europe compared to other regions

**Investigation areas**:
- Regional staffing levels comparison
- Market-specific factors affecting sales performance
- Localisation opportunities

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

### Data Processing
The analysis utilised a database containing **4 related tables**. A comprehensive merge table was created using advanced Google Sheets formulas:

- `ARRAYFORMULA` - for bulk operations
- `DAYDIFF` - for delivery time calculations  
- `VLOOKUP` - for data matching across tables
- `IF` - for conditional logic

### Analysis Approach
Following data preparation, **pivot tables** were employed for:
- Descriptive statistical analysis
- Data visualisation and chart creation
- Trend identification
